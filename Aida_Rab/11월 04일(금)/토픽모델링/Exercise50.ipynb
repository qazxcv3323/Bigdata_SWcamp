The data are defined at the national level only – i.e. for the whole of Canada. These data are used to estimate a total factor productivity (TFP) index for Canadian agriculture, which is the ratio of total gross output to total input, where both output and input are constant dollar implicit quantities. Average growth in the TFP index, referred to as TFP growth, can be estimated using a variety of methods; the growth rate reported in AAFC publications is estimated using OLS.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther documentation provided in AAFC_PACA.odt   \n",

These data are used to estimate a total factor productivity (TFP) index for Canadian agriculture, which is the ratio of total gross output to total input, where both output and input are constant dollar implicit quantities. Average growth in the TFP index, referred to as TFP growth, can be estimated using a variety of methods; the growth rate reported in AAFC publications is estimated using OLS.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther documentation provided in AAFC_PACA.odt'"
